You're My Heart, You're My Soul
Modern Talking
1985
Deep in my heart, there's a fire, a burnin' heart
Deep in my heart, there's desire for a start
I'm dying in emotion
It's my world in fantasy
I'm livin' in my, livin' in my dreams

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together

You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feelin' that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That is the only thing I really know

Let's close the door and believe my burnin' heart
Feeling all right come on, open up your heart
I'll keep the candles burning
Let your body melt in mine
I'm livin' in my, livin' in my dreams

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together

You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feelin' that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That is the only thing I really know

You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feelin' that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That is the only thing I really know

You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feelin' that our love will grow

Brother Louie
Modern Talking
1998
Dear, love is a burning fire
Stay, 'cause then the flames grows higher
Babe, don't let him steal your heart
It's easy, easy

Girl, this game can't last forever
Why? We cannot live together
Try? Don't let him take your love from me

You're no good, can't you see?
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie
'Cause I'm a lover

Stay, 'cause this boy wants to gamble
Stay, love's more than he can handle, girl
Oh, come and stay by me forever, ever

Why does he go on pretending?
That his love is never-ending, babe
Don't let him steal your love from me

You're no good, can't you see?
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me

Oh, let it, Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie
'Cause I'm a lover

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it Louie
'Cause I'm a lover

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie...

L'italiano
Toto Cutugno
1983
Lasciatemi cantare
Con la chitarra in mano
Lasciatemi cantare
Sono un italiano

Buongiorno Italia, gli spaghetti al dente
E un partigiano come presidente
Con l'autoradio sempre nella mano destra
Un canarino sopra la finestra

Buongiorno Italia con i tuoi artisti
Con troppa America sui manifesti
Con le canzoni, con amore
Con il cuore
Con più donne e sempre meno suore

Buongiorno Italia, buongiorno Maria
Con gli occhi pieni di malinconia
Buongiorno Dio
Lo sai che ci sono anch'io

Lasciatemi cantare
Con la chitarra in mano
Lasciatemi cantare
Una canzone piano piano

Lasciatemi cantare
Perché ne sono fiero
Sono un italiano
Un italiano vero

Buongiorno Italia che non si spaventa
Con la crema da barba alla menta
Con un vestito gessato sul blu
E la moviola la domenica in TV

Buongiorno Italia col caffè ristretto
Le calze nuove nel primo cassetto
Con la bandiera in tintoria
E una Seicento giù di carrozzeria

Buongiorno Italia, buongiorno Maria
Con gli occhi pieni di malinconia
Buongiorno Dio
Lo sai che ci sono anch'io

Lasciatemi cantare
Con la chitarra in mano
Lasciatemi cantare
Una canzone piano piano

Lasciatemi cantare
Perché ne sono fiero
Sono un italiano
Un italiano vero

Lasciatemi cantare
Con la chitarra in mano
Lasciatemi cantare
Una canzone piano piano

Lasciatemi cantare
Perché ne sono fiero
Sono un italiano
Un italiano vero

Bones
Imagine Dragons
2022
Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh)
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives (ooh)

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

Playing with a stick of dynamite
There was never gray in black and white
There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, oh)
Feeling like a boulder hurtling
Seeing all the vultures circling
Burning in the flames I'm working in
Turning in a bed that's darkening

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (in my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

'Cause there's magic in my bones

Look in the mirror of my mind
Turning the pages of my life
Walking the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leaving the ones that never cared
Picking the pieces up and building to the sky

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (soul)
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in

There goes my mind (I-I-I)
Don't mind
There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)
There goes my mind (I-I-I)
Don't mind (there it goes)
There goes my mind
'Cause there's magic in my bones
